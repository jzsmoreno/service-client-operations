# service-client-operations

A Azure Functions-based repository for securely transferring data between services using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
This project aims to provide a scalable and reliable solution for integrating multiple services by leveraging the power of Azure Functions. The service will utilize an SFTP connection to transfer files and data between different systems, ensuring secure and efficient communication.
## Key Features:
- Azure Function-based architecture
- Secure file transfer using SFTP protocol
- Integration with various services (e.g., APIs, databases)
- Scalable and reliable design for high-volume data transfers
## Goals:
- Provide a robust and scalable solution for service integration
- Ensure secure data transfer between systems
- Facilitate seamless communication between different services and applications

This repository will contain the code for an Azure Function that handles SFTP connections, as well as any supporting libraries or utilities needed to manage file transfers.
